## API Reference (For Developers)

This section is for developers who want to understand how to interact with the Sohbet backend.

### User Registration

Create a new user account:

```bash
POST /api/users
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "ali_student",
  "email": "ali@example.edu", 
  "password": "StrongPass123",
  "university": "Istanbul Technical University",
  "department": "Computer Engineering",
  "enrollment_year": 2023,
  "primary_language": "Turkish"
}
```

**Response** (201 Created):
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "username": "ali_student",
  "email": "ali@example.edu",
  "university": "Istanbul Technical University", 
  "department": "Computer Engineering",
  "enrollment_year": 2023,
  "primary_language": "Turkish"
}
```

### User Login

Authenticate and receive a login token:

```bash
POST /api/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "ali_student",
  "password": "StrongPass123"
}
```

**Response** (200 OK):
```json
{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "username": "ali_student",
    "email": "ali@example.edu"
  }
}
```

### User Retrieval
This returns a valid JWT token and user data for the demo account.

### Authentication Flow

**Backend Flow**
1. **Registration** (`POST /api/users`):
   - Client sends user data with password over HTTPS (plain-text in transit, encrypted by TLS)
   - Server validates input (username pattern, email format, password strength)
   - Password is hashed using bcrypt (12 rounds)
   - User record stored in SQLite database
   - Server responds with user data (password hash excluded)

2. **Login** (`POST /api/login`):
   - Client sends username and password over HTTPS
   - Server looks up user by username
   - Password verified using bcrypt comparison
   - JWT token generated using HS256 (HMAC-SHA256 with shared secret)
   - Token payload includes: username, user_id, expiration (24h)
   - Server responds with `{ "token": "...", "user": { ... } }`

**Frontend Flow** (React + TypeScript)
1. User enters credentials in `LoginForm.tsx`
2. `ApiService.login()` calls backend `/api/login` endpoint
3. On success, JWT token stored and set in axios headers
4. Token included in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header for authenticated requests
5. User data displayed in dashboard components

**Security Practices**
- Password hashes never returned in API responses (verified by tests)
- Input validation enforced on both frontend and backend
- JWT tokens signed with HS256 using a shared secret (server-side only)
- Tokens include expiration to limit validity window
- **Production Note**: Use HTTPS to encrypt password transmission; current implementation assumes secure transport layer

**Roadmap**

Phase 2: Friendships and messaging

Phase 3: News feed and groups

Get user profile information:

```bash
GET /api/users/:username
```

**Response** (200 OK):
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "username": "ali_student",
  "email": "ali@example.edu",
  "university": "Istanbul Technical University",
  "department": "Computer Engineering",
  "enrollment_year": 2023,
  "primary_language": "Turkish"
}
```

### Other Endpoints

- `GET /api/status` - Server status and version information
- `GET /api/users/demo` - Demo user data for testing

### Demo User

A demo account is automatically created for testing:

- **Username**: `demo_student`
- **Password**: `demo123`

**Example:**
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"demo_student","password":"demo123"}' \
  http://localhost:8080/api/login
```

### Error Responses

The API returns standard HTTP status codes:
- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid input or validation errors
- **401 Unauthorized**: Invalid credentials
- **404 Not Found**: User not found
- **409 Conflict**: Username or email already exists
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Database or system errors

## Building and Testing (For Developers)

### Using the Setup Script (Recommended)

The easiest way to build and start the server:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

This script will:
- Check that you have all required tools (CMake, Make, G++, curl)
- Build the C++ backend automatically
- Start the HTTP server on port 8080
- Test all API endpoints
- Show troubleshooting information if needed

### Manual Build Process

If you prefer to build manually:

#### Prerequisites
- CMake 3.16 or higher
- C++17 compatible compiler (GCC or Clang)
- SQLite3 development libraries
- OpenSSL development libraries
- Make (build-essential package)

#### Build Steps
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
cd ..
```

#### Run the Server
```bash
cd build
./sohbet
```

#### Test the API
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/status
curl http://localhost:8080/api/users/demo
```

### Running Tests

To run the automated test suite:

```bash
cd build
ctest
# Or for verbose output:
ctest -V
```

### Full Stack Development

To run both backend and frontend together:

```bash
./start-fullstack.sh
```

This starts:
- C++ backend server on port 8080
- React frontend development server on port 3000
- Automatic proxy configuration for API calls

---

## Troubleshooting

Having issues? Here are common problems and solutions:

### Backend Server Issues

#### Problem: Frontend shows "ECONNREFUSED" error

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify the server is running:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/api/status
   # Should return: {"status":"ok","version":"0.3.0-academic",...}
   ```

2. **Check if port 8080 is in use:**
   ```bash
   lsof -i :8080
   # Should show sohbet process
   ```

3. **Restart the server:**
   ```bash
   pkill -f sohbet
   ./setup.sh
   ```

#### Problem: Server won't start

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify the executable exists:**
   ```bash
   ls -la build/sohbet
   # Should exist and be executable
   ```

2. **Check server logs:**
   ```bash
   cd build && ./sohbet
   # Watch for error messages
   ```

3. **Verify dependencies:**
   ```bash
   ldd build/sohbet
   ```

#### Problem: Permission denied

**Solution:**
```bash
chmod +x build/sohbet
chmod +x setup.sh
```

#### Problem: Port 8080 already in use

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Find what's using port 8080
lsof -i :8080

# Kill the process (replace PID with actual ID)
kill <PID>

# Or kill all sohbet processes
pkill -f sohbet
```

### Build Issues

#### Problem: CMake configuration fails

**Solutions:**

1. **Install missing dependencies:**
   
   On Ubuntu/Debian:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install cmake build-essential libsqlite3-dev libssl-dev
   ```
   
   On macOS (with Homebrew):
   ```bash
   brew install cmake sqlite openssl
   ```

2. **Check CMake version:**
   ```bash
   cmake --version  # Should be 3.16 or higher
   ```

3. **Clean and rebuild:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf build
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake ..
   ```

#### Problem: Make build fails

**Solutions:**

1. **Check compiler version:**
   ```bash
   g++ --version  # Should support C++17
   ```

2. **Clean rebuild:**
   ```bash
   cd build
   make clean
   make
   ```

3. **Verbose build to see detailed errors:**
   ```bash
   make VERBOSE=1
   ```

### Frontend Issues

#### Problem: Frontend can't reach backend API

**Verification Steps:**

1. Backend server is running: `curl http://localhost:8080/api/status`
2. Frontend proxy is configured: Check `frontend/package.json` for `"proxy": "http://localhost:8080"`
3. CORS headers are present: Server should return `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`

**Solution:**

Use the full stack startup script which handles all configuration:
```bash
./start-fullstack.sh
```

### Testing the Complete Setup

Run these commands to verify everything is working:

```bash
# Test all endpoints
curl -v http://localhost:8080/api/status
curl -v http://localhost:8080/api/users/demo

# Test user registration
curl -v -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"test","email":"test@example.edu","password":"TestPass123"}' \
  http://localhost:8080/api/users

# Check server health (with formatted output)
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/status | python3 -m json.tool
```

## Technical Architecture (For Developers)

### System Components

Sohbet is built with a clean separation of concerns:

- **Models**: User data structures with academic profile fields and JSON serialization
- **Database**: SQLite with RAII wrapper, migrations, and safe query operations
- **Repositories**: Data access layer providing CRUD operations
- **Security**: bcrypt password hashing and JWT token management
- **Server**: HTTP request handlers and API endpoint routing
- **Utils**: Hashing utilities and input validation helpers
- **Password Hashing**: Production-ready bcrypt with 12 rounds
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with HMAC-SHA256 signatures
- **Data Protection**: No sensitive data in API responses
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation and sanitization

**Security Implementation**: The backend uses industry-standard bcrypt (via libbcrypt) for secure password hashing and JWT (HS256) for stateless authentication. All security tests pass and verify no password leakage in API responses.

## Test Coverage ‚úÖ

Comprehensive unit and integration tests ensure authentication security and correctness.

### Authentication Tests (`tests/test_authentication.cpp`)

**User Registration**
- ‚úÖ Successful registration returns user data with ID
- ‚úÖ Password hashes are never exposed in API responses
- ‚úÖ User data properly serialized without sensitive fields

**User Login**
- ‚úÖ Successful login with valid credentials returns JWT token and user data
- ‚úÖ Failed login with wrong password returns 401 error
- ‚úÖ Failed login with non-existent user returns 401 error
- ‚úÖ Error responses never contain tokens

**JWT Token Management**
- ‚úÖ Token generation creates valid JWT with correct structure
- ‚úÖ Token verification decodes and validates payload (username, user_id)
- ‚úÖ Invalid tokens are properly rejected
- ‚úÖ Token expiration is set and enforced

**Demo User**
- ‚úÖ Demo user auto-created on server initialization
- ‚úÖ Login with demo credentials (demo_student / demo123) succeeds
- ‚úÖ Login with wrong demo password fails with 401

### Other Test Suites
- **BcryptTest**: Password hashing, verification, and legacy compatibility
- **UserTest**: User model validation and JSON serialization
- **UserRepositoryTest**: Database CRUD operations and uniqueness constraints
- **VoiceServiceTest**: Voice channel configuration and token generation

### Running Tests
```bash
cd build
ctest --output-on-failure
```

All tests are registered in CMakeLists.txt and run via CTest. Tests use in-memory databases to ensure isolation and repeatability.
