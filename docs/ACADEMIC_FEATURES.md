# Academic Features - Technical Planning

This document outlines the technical details for future academic features in Sohbet. It's intended for developers who want to understand what's planned and how it will be implemented.

## Database Schema Evolution

### Current Database Tables

**✅ Implemented**:
- `users` - User profiles with academic information (university, department, enrollment year, etc.)

### Planned Database Tables

**📋 Future Implementation**:
- `courses` - Course information and metadata
- `study_groups` - Study group definitions
- `enrollments` - Student-course relationships
- `group_memberships` - User-group relationships
- `posts` - Discussion posts and content
- `comments` - Threaded discussion comments
- `questions` - Q&A questions for academic help
- `answers` - Answers to Q&A questions

## Security Status and Roadmap

### ✅ Current Security Implementation

- ✅ **Secure password hashing**: bcrypt with 12 computational rounds
- ✅ **JWT-based authentication**: HS256 signatures for session tokens
- ✅ **Input validation**: Comprehensive validation and sanitization
- ✅ **SQL injection prevention**: Using prepared statements
- ✅ **Password protection**: Hashes never exposed in API responses
- ✅ **Basic error handling**: Proper error responses

### 📋 Security Improvements Needed

**Medium Priority**:
- 🟡 Rate limiting for API endpoints
- 🟡 Audit logging system
- 🟡 Enhanced input sanitization

**Low Priority**:
- 🟢 Advanced session management
- 🟢 Security penetration testing

---

## Testing Strategy

### ✅ Implemented Tests

- ✅ Unit tests for models and repositories
- ✅ Integration tests for database operations
- ✅ Authentication flow tests (bcrypt + JWT)

### 📋 Planned Tests

- [ ] Load testing for concurrent users
- [ ] Security penetration testing
- [ ] End-to-end testing scenarios

---

## Documentation Status

### ✅ Complete

- ✅ API documentation with examples
- ✅ Build and deployment instructions
- ✅ Security warnings and disclaimers

### 📋 In Progress

- [ ] Detailed architecture documentation
- [ ] Database migration guides
- [ ] Contribution guidelines

---

## Next Sprint Planning

### Immediate Priorities (Phase 3, Increment 1)

1. **Course & Study Group Foundations**
   - Design and implement database schema
   - Create repository layer for CRUD operations

2. **Content Features**
   - Basic post creation endpoint
   - Post retrieval and listing

3. **Testing Expansion**
   - Cover new schema with tests
   - Test new API flows

4. **Security Enhancements**
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add audit logging

### Success Criteria for Next Release (v0.3.0)

- ✅ Course and study group tables created
- ✅ Basic post API operational
- ✅ Authentication coverage expanded in tests
- ✅ Initial rate limiting implemented
- ✅ Updated developer documentation

## Risk Assessment

### ⚠️ High Risk Items

1. **Database Growth**
   - **Risk**: Database may grow large as users create content
   - **Impact**: Slower queries, increased storage needs

2. **Security Gaps**
   - **Risk**: Rate limiting and comprehensive logging not yet implemented
   - **Impact**: Vulnerable to abuse and attacks

3. **Feature Expansion**
   - **Risk**: New content models add complexity
   - **Impact**: Harder to maintain, more bugs possible

### ✅ Mitigation Strategies

1. **For Database Growth**:
   - Prioritize schema design reviews before migration
   - Plan indexing strategy early
   - Consider query optimization from the start

2. **For Security Gaps**:
   - Implement rate limiting in next sprint
   - Add comprehensive audit logging
   - Regular security reviews

3. **For Feature Complexity**:
   - Incremental testing of new features
   - Plan phased rollout of new modules
   - Maintain clear documentation
