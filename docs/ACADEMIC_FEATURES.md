### Database Schema Evolution

**Current Tables:**
- `users` - User profiles with academic information

**Planned Tables:**
- `courses` - Course information and metadata
- `study_groups` - Study group definitions
- `enrollments` - Student-course relationships
- `group_memberships` - User-group relationships
- `posts` - Discussion posts and content
- `comments` - Threaded discussion comments
- `questions` - Q&A questions
- `answers` - Q&A answers

### Security Roadmap

#### Current Security Status
- âœ… **Secure password hashing**: bcrypt (12 rounds)  
- âœ… JWT-based authentication with HS256 signatures  
- âœ… Input validation and sanitization  
- âœ… SQL injection prevention via prepared statements  
- âœ… Password hash exclusion from API responses  
- âœ… Basic error handling  

#### Security Improvements Needed
- ðŸŸ¡ **MEDIUM**: Rate limiting for API endpoints  
- ðŸŸ¡ **MEDIUM**: Audit logging system  
- ðŸŸ¡ **MEDIUM**: Input sanitization enhancements  
- ðŸŸ¢ **LOW**: Advanced session management  
- ðŸŸ¢ **LOW**: Security penetration testing  

---

### Testing Strategy
- âœ… Unit tests for models and repositories  
- âœ… Integration tests for database operations  
- âœ… Authentication flow tests (bcrypt + JWT)  
- [ ] Load testing for concurrent users  
- [ ] Security penetration testing  
- [ ] End-to-end testing scenarios  

---

### Documentation Status
- âœ… API documentation with examples  
- âœ… Build and deployment instructions  
- âœ… Security warnings and disclaimers  
- [ ] Architecture documentation  
- [ ] Database migration guides  
- [ ] Contribution guidelines

## Next Sprint Planning

### Immediate Priorities (Phase 3, Increment 1)
1. **Course & Study Group Foundations** â€“ Begin schema and repository implementation  
2. **Content Features** â€“ Basic post creation endpoint  
3. **Testing Expansion** â€“ Cover new schema and API flows  
4. **Security Enhancements** â€“ Add rate limiting  

### Success Criteria for Next Release (v0.3.0)
- Course and study group tables created  
- Basic post API operational  
- Authentication coverage expanded in tests  
- Initial rate limiting implemented  
- Updated developer documentation

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
- **Database Growth**: Need optimization strategy for scaling  
- **Security Gaps**: Rate limiting and logging not yet implemented  
- **Feature Expansion**: New content models add complexity  

### Mitigation Strategies
- Prioritize schema design reviews before migration  
- Incremental testing of new features  
- Early consideration of indexing and optimization  
- Plan phased rollout of new modules
