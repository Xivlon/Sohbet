---

## Security Implementation

### What's Already Secure

- âœ… **Token-based architecture** - Framework for secure authentication
- âœ… **Time-limited access** - Tokens expire automatically
- âœ… **Permission framework** - Structure for validating user permissions
- âœ… **Configuration validation** - Settings are checked for validity
- âœ… **No hardcoded credentials** - All secrets come from environment variables

### Ready for Production Deployment

When moving to production, these features are ready to be implemented:

- ðŸ”œ **JWT token generation** - Architecture is in place
- ðŸ”œ **Database token storage** - Schema is documented
- ðŸ”œ **Audit logging** - Interface is defined
- ðŸ”œ **Rate limiting** - Hooks are ready

---

## How to Use It

### For Backend Developers

Here's a simple example of using the voice service in C++:

```cpp
#include "voice/voice_service.h"

// Create configuration
VoiceConfig config;
config.enabled = true;
config.load_from_env();

// Create service (stub for testing)
VoiceServiceStub service(config);

// Create a channel
VoiceChannel channel = service.create_channel(
    "Study Group",           // name
    "CS101 meeting",         // description
    user_id,                 // creator
    10,                      // max users
    true                     // temporary
);

// Generate connection token
VoiceConnectionToken token = service.generate_connection_token(
    user_id,
    channel.id
);
```

### For Frontend Developers

Here's how to use it in a React component:

```typescript
import { useVoiceChannels } from './hooks/useVoice';

function MyComponent() {
  const { channels, loading, createChannel } = useVoiceChannels();

  // Create a channel
  const handleCreate = async () => {
    const newChannel = await createChannel({
      name: "My Channel",
      description: "Test channel",
      max_users: 10
    });
    
    if (newChannel) {
      console.log("Channel created:", newChannel);
    }
  };

  // Display channels
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleCreate}>Create Channel</button>
      {channels.map(channel => (
        <div key={channel.channel_id}>{channel.name}</div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Configuration

### Setting Up the Voice Service

Set these environment variables to enable and configure voice features:

```bash
# Enable voice service
export SOHBET_VOICE_ENABLED=true

# Murmur server settings
export SOHBET_MURMUR_HOST=localhost
export SOHBET_MURMUR_PORT=64738
export SOHBET_MURMUR_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password

# Token settings (5 minutes)
export SOHBET_VOICE_TOKEN_EXPIRY=300

# Channel settings
export SOHBET_VOICE_MAX_USERS=25
export SOHBET_VOICE_ENABLE_RECORDING=false
```

## Testing Results

The voice integration includes comprehensive tests. All tests pass successfully:

```

## What Comes Next

### Phase 2: Core Integration

The next phase involves connecting to a real Murmur server:

1. **Murmur Connection**: Implement actual server communication
2. **REST API Endpoints**: Add voice endpoints to the HTTP server
3. **Database Integration**: Store channels and tokens in SQLite
4. **Token Persistence**: Implement database-backed token validation

### Phase 3: User Interface

Build the UI components for voice features:

1. **Channel List Component**: Display available voice channels
2. **Create Channel Dialog**: UI for creating new channels
3. **Join Channel Button**: Easy one-click joining
4. **Connection Status**: Show current voice connection state

### Phase 4: Enhanced Features

Add advanced capabilities:

1. **WebRTC Support**: Browser-based calling without Murmur client
2. **Mobile Apps**: iOS and Android native support
3. **Screen Sharing**: Share screens during calls
4. **Recording**: Optional call recording with user consent
